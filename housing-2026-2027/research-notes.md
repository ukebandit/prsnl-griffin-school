## Rental Prices (La Jolla / UTC / 92122)

### Per-Person Costs (with roommates)

| Room Type | Monthly Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Shared bedroom | $700–$1,100 | Cheapest option, common near UCSD |
| Private bedroom | $1,100–$1,600 | Standard for most groups |
| Studio (solo) | $2,000–$2,200+ | No roommates needed |

### Whole-Unit Averages

| Unit Type | Monthly Rent | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 2BR apartment (University City) | ~$3,200 | UCSD comparable rental data |
| 2BR/2BA (Allina La Jolla) | ~$3,500 | Reddit user report |
| 3BR/2.5BA townhouse (La Jolla Village Tennis Club) | $4,800 | UCSD off-campus housing listing |
| 2BR/2BA (Jewel at Lux — luxury) | $4,200 | Reddit user report |
| 2BR general (La Jolla area) | $3,194–$5,000 | Trulia |

### What This Means for a 5–6 Person Group

| Total Rent | N=5 | N=6 |
|-----------|------|------|
| $4,000/mo | $800 | $667 |
| $4,800/mo | $960 | $800 |
| $5,500/mo | $1,100 | $917 |
| $6,500/mo | $1,300 | $1,083 |

A 3BR or 4BR in the $4,800–$6,500 range with 5–6 people lands in the $800–$1,300/person sweet spot.

## Move-In / Upfront Costs

| Expense | Typical Range |
|---------|--------------|
| Security deposit | 1 month's rent ($4,000–$6,500) |
| First month's rent | Same as monthly |
| Application fees | $30–$75 per person (non-refundable) |
| **Total upfront per person (N=5)** | **~$2,500–$4,000** |

---

## Income Verification — Big Gotcha

Landlords typically require **2.5–3x monthly rent** in provable income.

- For a $5,000/month unit, that's $12,500–$15,000/month combined income
- **Workarounds** (per Reddit):
  - Parent co-sign on the lease (most common for students)
  - Large bank balance (some use Payscore which reads average deposits)
  - Proof of financial aid / stipend letters
- This is the #1 reason applications get rejected — plan for it early

## Key Dates: Off-Campus Lease Hunting

| Window | What Happens |
|--------|-------------|
| Feb–Apr 2026 | Early bird listings start appearing; best time to lock a group |
| May–Jun 2026 | Peak listing season for Sep move-ins; competition intensifies |
| Jun–Jul 2026 | Late-cycle; fewer options, possible desperation pricing |
| Aug 2026 | Last-minute scramble; sublets and leftovers |
| Sep 2026 | Move-in |

Per Reddit: start searching **4–6 weeks minimum** before target move-in, earlier for large complexes. June and September are peak listing months.

## UCSD On-Campus Housing (Fallback)

> **Note**: The group is all undergrads (1 rising sophomore, 5 rising juniors), so undergraduate housing is the relevant fallback — not graduate/family housing.

- Sophomores with a housing guarantee may have priority; juniors typically do not
- Room Selection Sign-Up runs Apr 16–30 (by college)

### Graduate/Family Housing (likely not applicable, included for reference)

| Mesa Nueva | Studios, 1–3 BR | LEED Gold, in-unit W/D, dishwasher, parking |
| Nuevo East | Various | Newer construction |
| Nuevo West | Various | Newer construction |
| One Miramar St. | Various | |
| Mesa | Various | Older, more affordable |
| Coast | Various | |

## Where to Search — Platform Ranking (per Reddit consensus)

| Platform | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| **UCSD Off-Campus Housing Portal** (offcampushousing.ucsd.edu) | Official, reliable, includes roommate search |
| **Facebook: UCSD Off Campus Housing** (facebook.com/groups/2387457222) | Very active but **scam-prone** — one user flagged "compromised admin" |
| **Facebook: UCSD Off Campus Housing San Diego Rentals** | Alternative group |
| **Zillow** | Good for direct landlord listings |
| **Apartments.com** | Good, has app |
| **Redfin** | Supplementary |
| **Craigslist** | Viable but high scam risk |
| **Discord servers** | UCSD-specific servers exist |
| **Word of mouth** | Reddit's #1 recommendation |

### Scam Warnings

- Facebook groups are the most scam-heavy channel
- Never send money before seeing a place in person
- If a deal seems too good, it probably is
- UCSD Student Legal Services offers **free lease review** — use it

## Tips from r/UCSD Students

- "Roommates make it affordable but the hardest thing besides finding roommates is getting past the income threshold"
- "Start early. You want to have good roommates."
- "The further you get from campus, the more decent and affordable, but commuting becomes more of a pain"
- "Look for places that have move-in bonuses like first month rent free"
- The Mirada apartments offer "medium income housing" discounted rates — worth calling to check
- 5 people in a 2BR/2BA is doable (triple + double) if budget is tight
- Villas of Renaissance mentioned multiple times: ~$1,600/person for private master but far from bus stops
