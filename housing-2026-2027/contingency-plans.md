# Contingency Plans

Housing plans break. This document maps out degradation paths so the group can pivot quickly when conditions change.

---

## Decision Tree Overview

```
Plan A (baseline)
 ├── roommate drops out ──────────► Plan B
 ├── can't find affordable place ──► Plan C
 └── everything falls apart ──────► Plan D
```

---

## Plan A — Baseline

**Assumption**: Full group secured, target property found, lease signed on time.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Group size | 5–6 (Ray, Griffin, Vivi, V, Alex (conditional), Jack (possible)) |
| Target rent (per person) | $800–$1,300/mo |
| Lease start | Sep 1, 2026 |
| Listing search window | May–Jun 2026 (peak season) |
| Application window | Jun–Jul 2026 |

**Known risk**: Alex may transfer to UC Davis. Jack is a possible 6th but not confirmed.

**This plan succeeds if**: At least 5 hard-commit roommates follow through, income verification / co-signers are sorted, and at least one target property accepts the application.

---

## Plan B — Roommate Drops Out

**Trigger**: One or more confirmed roommates bail before or after lease signing.

### Before Lease Signed

| Action | Owner | Deadline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Activate backup roommate(s) from soft-commit list | _TBD_ | Within 1 week of dropout |
| Re-run money matrix with new group size | _TBD_ | Same week |
| If no backup available, downsize target property | _TBD_ | Within 2 weeks |
| If group falls below minimum viable size, escalate to Plan C or D | _TBD_ | Immediately |

### After Lease Signed

| Action | Owner | Deadline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Departing roommate finds subletter (per lease terms) | Departing person | 30 days |
| If no subletter, remaining group covers gap temporarily | Group | Until subletter found |
| Post on UCSD housing boards for subletter | _TBD_ | Within 48 hours |
| Consult lease for early termination / subletting clauses | _TBD_ | Before signing |

### Financial Buffer

- [ ] Agree on a small emergency fund ($200–500 total) to cover gap months
- [ ] Clarify who is liable if someone disappears mid-lease

---

## Plan C — Can't Find an Affordable Place

**Trigger**: Target properties are full, too expensive, or won't approve the application.

### Escalation Ladder

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Expand search radius | Beyond La Jolla / UTC — consider Clairemont, Pacific Beach, Mira Mesa |
| 2 | Adjust group size | Add a roommate to bring per-person cost down |
| 3 | Adjust timeline | Look for Oct or Jan move-in instead of Sep |
| 4 | Consider UCSD on-campus housing | Mesa Nueva, Nuevo East/West, Mesa, Coast — rates ~20% below market, 3% annual cap. Huge waitlists historically. |
| 5 | Short-term bridge housing | Airbnb / sublet for 1–2 months while continuing search |

### Expanded Search Areas

| Area | Distance to UCSD | Approx. Savings vs. La Jolla |
|------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Clairemont | 15–20 min | 20–30% cheaper |
| Pacific Beach | 15–20 min | 10–20% cheaper |
| Mira Mesa | 20–25 min (car preferred) | 25–35% cheaper |
| North Park / Normal Heights | 20–30 min | 20–30% cheaper |

### Market Watch

Keep a pulse on the rental market so Plan C activations aren't surprises:

- [ ] Set up alerts on Zillow / Apartments.com for target criteria
- [ ] Check UCSD Off-Campus Housing Portal (offcampushousing.ucsd.edu) weekly
- [ ] Monitor Facebook group: UCSD Off Campus Housing — but watch for scams
- [ ] Track average rent trends in target neighborhoods monthly
- [ ] UCSD on-campus housing fallback: application window is **Feb 18–26, 2026** — don't miss it

---

## Plan D — Everything Falls Apart

**Trigger**: No viable group, no affordable housing, or major life change (leave of absence, transfer, etc.).

### Solo Fallback Options

| Option | Estimated Cost | Pros | Cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| UCSD on-campus grad housing (Mesa Nueva, etc.) | $1,400–1,800/mo | On campus, 20% below market | Long waitlists, limited availability |
| Studio apartment (La Jolla/UTC) | $2,000–2,200+/mo | Full privacy | Very expensive |
| Room in shared house (strangers) | $800–1,300/mo | Cheap | Unknown roommates; use UCSD portal or Zillow |
| Stay with family (if local) | $0 | Free | Commute, independence |
| Defer enrollment / gap period | $0 | Reset | Delays program |

### Emergency Checklist

- [ ] Notify Griffin School admin of housing situation if it may affect enrollment
- [ ] Check UCSD emergency housing resources
- [ ] Review financial aid implications of any changes
- [ ] Set a personal hard deadline for making a solo decision: _TBD date_

---

## Plan Activation Protocol

When a plan needs to activate:

1. **Acknowledge** — Name the trigger out loud in the group chat. No ambiguity.
2. **Assess** — How much time is left? What resources remain?
3. **Act** — Execute the relevant action table above. Assign owners.
4. **Update** — Revise the money matrix and timeline. Communicate changes to all parties.

---

## Key Dates & Deadlines

| Date | Milestone | Contingency Relevance |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Feb 18–26, 2026** | UCSD on-campus housing application window | Last chance for on-campus fallback — submit interest NOW |
| Mar 3, 2026 | UCSD contract offer updates (on-campus) | Know if on-campus is an option |
| _TBD (suggest Apr 15)_ | Hard-commit deadline for roommate group | After this, Plan B activates for dropouts |
| _TBD_ | Alex's UC Davis admission decision | If admitted → Plan B activation |
| May–Jun 2026 | Peak off-campus listing season | Prime application window |
| _TBD (suggest Jun 30)_ | Lease signing deadline | Miss this → Plan C/D escalation |
| _TBD_ | Personal solo-decision deadline | Plan D last resort |
| Sep 2026 | Move-in (est. mid-Sep based on prior years) | All plans converge here |

## Open Questions

- [ ] What's the minimum viable group size? (i.e., at what point does the plan collapse?)
- [ ] Does anyone have a personal Plan D already (family nearby, etc.)?
- [ ] Are there any academic deadlines (e.g., enrollment confirmation) that gate housing decisions?
- [ ] Should we set a shared emergency fund, and how much?
