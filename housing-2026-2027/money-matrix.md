# Money Matrix

## Goal

Model the full cost of housing under different group sizes, locations, and split strategies so everyone can make informed decisions.

## 1. Monthly Cost Breakdown Template

Use this template per property/scenario. Calibrated for 5–6 person group:

| Expense | Total/Month | Per Person (N=5) | Per Person (N=6) |
|---------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Rent | $ | $ | $ |
| Utilities (electric/gas) | ~$150–250 | ~$30–50 | ~$25–42 |
| Internet | ~$60–80 | ~$12–16 | ~$10–13 |
| Water/trash (if separate) | varies | varies | varies |
| Parking (if needed) | $50–150/spot | individual | individual |
| Renter's insurance | ~$15–30/person | ~$15–30 | ~$15–30 |
| **Monthly Total** | **$** | **$** | **$** |

---

## 2. One-Time Costs

Expect **$2,500–$4,000 per person** upfront (per market data).

| Expense | Total | Split? | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Security deposit | $4,000–6,500 (1 mo rent) | Even | ~$800–$1,300/person @ 5 |
| First/last month prepay | Same as rent | Even | Depends on landlord |
| Application fees | $30–75/person | Each | Non-refundable per person |
| Moving costs | varies | Individual | Truck, boxes, etc. |
| Furniture (shared) | $ | Even | Couch, kitchen table, etc. |
| Furniture (personal) | $ | Individual | Desk, bed, etc. |

> **Income verification warning**: Landlords require 2.5–3x monthly rent in provable income. For a $5,000/mo unit that's $12,500–$15,000/mo combined. Most student groups need a **parent co-signer**. Plan for this early — it can delay or kill applications.

## 3. Split Models

### Model A: Even Split
Everyone pays `total / N`. Simple, fair when bedrooms are similar.

### Model B: Bedroom-Weighted Split
Larger or private bedrooms pay more. Formula:

```
base_share = common_area_costs / N
room_premium = (room_sqft / total_bedroom_sqft) * total_rent_portion
person_total = base_share + room_premium
```

### Model C: Income-Adjusted (if applicable)
Sliding scale based on stipend/income differences. Requires trust and transparency.

| Person | Monthly Income | % of Group Income | Adjusted Rent |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| A | $ | % | $ |
| B | $ | % | $ |
| C | $ | % | $ |

## 4. Budget Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Budget ($700–1000/person/month)
- Target neighborhoods: Clairemont, Mira Mesa, University City (further from campus)
- Property types: Shared rooms, older apartments, 3–4 BR split 5–6 ways
- Example: $4,000–$5,000/mo unit ÷ 6 = $667–$833/person
- Trade-offs: Longer commute, fewer amenities, may need shared bedrooms
- Income verification: ~$10,000–$15,000/mo combined (2.5–3x rent) — likely needs co-signer

### Scenario 2: Mid-Range ($1000–1300/person/month)
- Target neighborhoods: UTC, University City, La Jolla (older stock)
- Property types: 3–4 BR apartments, townhouses near campus
- Example: $4,800–$6,500/mo unit ÷ 5 = $960–$1,300/person
- Trade-offs: Balanced cost vs. convenience, transit accessible
- Real listing: 3BR/2.5BA La Jolla Village Tennis Club = $4,800/mo ($960/person @ 5)

### Scenario 3: Comfort ($1300–1800/person/month)
- Target neighborhoods: La Jolla (near campus), UTC (newer builds)
- Property types: Newer builds, townhouses, luxury apartments
- Example: Jewel at Lux 2BR/2BA = $4,200/mo; Allina La Jolla 2BR/2BA = $3,500/mo
- Trade-offs: Higher cost, better quality of life, walk/bike to campus
- Note: At this tier with 5–6 people, you're looking at 4BR+ or premium 3BR units

## 5. Payment Logistics

- [ ] **Collection method**: Venmo / Zelle / Splitwise / joint account?
- [ ] **Due date**: Align with lease due date (usually 1st of month)
- [ ] **Late policy**: Grace period? Penalty?
- [ ] **Whose name on the lease?**: All parties, or one primary leaseholder?

| Property | Address | Beds/Baths | Rent | Deposit | Lease Term | Distance to Campus | Laundry | Parking | Score |
|----------|---------|-----------|------|---------|------------|-------------------|---------|---------|-------|
| | | | | | | | | | /10 |
| | | | | | | | | | /10 |

## 7. Open Questions

- [ ] What's the hard ceiling on per-person monthly cost?
- [ ] Does anyone have a car that needs parking?
- [ ] Any financial aid or housing stipends to factor in?
- [ ] Preference for 12-month vs. 9-month lease?
