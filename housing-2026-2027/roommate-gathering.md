# Roommate Gathering

## Goal

Assemble a compatible group of roommates for the 2026/2027 academic year, with enough backups to survive dropouts.

---

## 1. Candidate Pipeline

### Sources
- [ ] Griffin School classmates (direct outreach)
- [ ] UCSD housing boards / Facebook groups / Discord
- [ ] Friends-of-friends referrals
- [ ] UCSD off-campus housing portal

### Tracking

| Name | Year | Gender | Orientation | Budget Range | Lifestyle Notes | Status |
|------|------|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| Ray | Rising junior | Trans | | | | |
| Griffin | Rising sophomore | Male | Straight | | | |
| Vivi | Rising junior | Female | Gay/pan | | | |
| V | Rising junior | Female | Gay/pan | | | |
| Alex | Rising junior | Female | Gay/pan | **Wildcard** — may transfer to UC Davis (see risk below) | | Conditional |
| Jack | Rising junior | Male | Straight | | Possible 6th | Interested |

> All undergrads. Griffin is a rising sophomore; everyone else is a rising junior.
> Mixed-gender group (2 straight males, 3 females, 1 trans). This is a **mixed-gender household** — relevant for lease applications and bedroom arrangements.

> **Risk flag — Alex**: If Alex is admitted to UC Davis, she drops out of the group. This is a known variable; Plan B roommate-dropout scenario applies. Keep a backup candidate warm for this slot specifically.

## 2. Vetting Criteria

Rank each candidate on a simple 1–5 scale:

| Criterion | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Budget alignment | High | Must overlap with target rent range |
| Schedule compatibility | Medium | Class/study/sleep patterns |
| Cleanliness standards | Medium | Kitchen, bathroom, common areas |
| Guest/party expectations | Medium | Frequency, noise tolerance |
| Lease commitment reliability | High | Can they actually sign and pay? |
| Pet situation | Low | Allergies, lease restrictions |

---

## 3. Commitment Stages

```
Interested → Soft Commit → Hard Commit → Lease Signed
```

- **Interested**: Expressed willingness, no obligation.
- **Soft Commit**: Verbal/written agreement to pursue housing together. Shared budget expectations.
- **Hard Commit**: Agreed on a specific property/price. Ready to apply.
- **Lease Signed**: Done. Legally bound.

### Target Numbers

| Role | Count | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Core group (hard commits) | 5–6 | Ray, Griffin, Vivi, V, Alex (conditional), +1 TBD |
| Backups (soft commits) | _TBD_ | Need at least 1 backup — especially to cover Alex's slot |

---

## 4. Communication Plan

- **Group chat**: _TBD platform_ (iMessage / Discord / WhatsApp)
- **Check-in cadence**: Biweekly until May, then weekly
- **Decision deadline**: Hard commits locked by _TBD date_

---

## 5. Open Questions

- [x] How many total roommates are we targeting? → 5–6 (see tracking table)
- [ ] Any geographic preferences within La Jolla / UTC area?
- [ ] Are any current roommates carrying over from this year (on-campus → off-campus)?
- [x] Mixed-gender housing or same-gender preference? → **Mixed-gender group confirmed** (2M, 3F, 1 trans). Need to ensure any target property/landlord is fine with co-ed living. UCSD Gender Inclusive Housing option exists for on-campus fallback.
- [ ] Bedroom pairing preferences? (Who's comfortable sharing a room with whom?) Partial info below:

### Room Pairing Notes

| Person | Will Room With |
|--------|---------------|
| Alex | Anyone **except Jack** |
| Griffin | Anyone |
| Ray | _TBD_ |
| Vivi | _TBD_ |
| V | _TBD_ |
| Jack | _TBD_ (note: Alex won't room with him) |

**ACTION ITEM**: Ask Ray, Vivi, V, and Jack who they're comfortable rooming with (and any hard no's). Need this before bedroom configs can be planned.

- [ ] Does Griffin being a sophomore affect housing eligibility or guarantees differently than the juniors?
- [ ] Does anyone still have an on-campus housing guarantee they could fall back on?
